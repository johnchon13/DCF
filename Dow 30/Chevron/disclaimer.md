Valuing Chevron and other oil and gas companies is tough and can be very volatile, as their business is built on crude oil and diesel prices. Government policy and regulation also plays a role in the volatility of the share prie. The DCF Model may not do a good job forecasting a price, as economists and analysts differ as to where the economy, oil, and government policies are going. The valuation also does not price in dividends.
